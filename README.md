Purpose: This is my CSS Final Project using GitHub Pages and CSS ZEN GARDEN files with the intent to modify style.css and style2.css for two different styles that can be applied to index.html with respect to the project guidelines. Both CSS files have been validated. 
- The first theme (style.css) is Newspaper, the second theme (style2.css) is Mysticism. Folders called assets1 and fonts1 belong to style.css, while assets2 and fonts2 belong to style2.css.
